## Description

TreeDir is our first project using <b>The C programming language</b> which is a a program that simulates tree manipulation system instructions
folders/files. The program will take as input a file containing a list of instructions
and will have to simulate these instructions by manipulating a 'tree' stored in memory. The program will move
in the tree structure, will be able to create folders/files, move, copy or delete folders/files.
